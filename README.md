# Decoupled Use Cases
In this example, the CreateUser command handler from the app package is responsible for orchestrating the user creation
process, while the domain package contains the business logic and validation rules.
The sql package handles database operations, decoupling the storage mechanism from the rest of the application.


## Pros:
* *Easier testing*: Each component can be tested independently, resulting in more focused and maintainable test cases.
* *Reduced accidental complexity*: By separating concerns, the code is less likely to introduce unintended complexity, as each component is responsible for a single task.
* *Increased development velocity*: With a decoupled architecture, developers can work on different parts of the application simultaneously without conflicts or dependencies.
* *Standardization of use cases*: The decoupled approach encourages the creation of reusable components and patterns, promoting the standardization of use cases.
* Improved maintainability: Decoupling allows for easier code modifications and updates, as changes to one component are less likely to impact others. This results in a more maintainable and scalable codebase.


## Cons:
* *Increased initial development time*: Decoupling requires more upfront work in designing the architecture and creating the necessary abstractions.
* *Higher learning curve*: Developers new to the project may take longer to understand the decoupled architecture and how the components interact.


# Coupled Use Cases

This can result in a more straightforward implementation and a faster initial development process.
However, this approach is likely to introduce challenges in testing, accidental complexity, and maintainability.

## Pros
* *Faster initial development*: With less focus on separation of concerns, developers can implement features more quickly.
* *Simpler architecture*: A coupled architecture is generally easier to understand, as there are fewer abstractions and components.

## Cons
* *Harder testing*: Coupled components are more challenging to test, as dependencies cannot be easily mocked or replaced. Tests may become more complex, and it can be difficult to isolate failures.
* *Increased accidental complexity*: Combining responsibilities in a single component increases the likelihood of introducing accidental complexity, as developers must manage multiple concerns simultaneously.
* *Slower development velocity*: Coupled architecture makes it harder for developers to work on different parts of the application simultaneously, as changes in one area can introduce dependencies or conflicts in others.
* *Lack of standardization*: Coupled use cases tend to be less reusable and harder to standardize, as the code is more tightly intertwined.
* *Reduced maintainability*: Coupled components are harder to maintain, as changes to one part of the code can have unintended consequences and introduce new bugs. This can lead to increased technical debt and a less scalable codebase.
